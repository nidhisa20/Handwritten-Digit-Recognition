# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project is a machine learning-based digit classification system trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated on both MNIST and SVHN (Street View House Numbers) datasets. It demonstrates a pipeline for training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction of handwritten and street view digits using a CNN built with TensorFlow and other tools.
